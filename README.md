# CodableRequestLibrary

Helper class that makes it easy to use a REST endpoint with Swift's structured concurrency and codables. There is an implentation for GET that takes an address and decodes the resulting json into a Swift struct. There is a POST implementation that sends an encodable and receives a decoable.

Wrapping all that functionality means the caller has to deal with a large range of possible errors and exceptions. To unify the error path a wrapper Error is used that transcodes framework errors and also generates new types of errors when needed.

See the included test for example codable structs and a couple of tests.
